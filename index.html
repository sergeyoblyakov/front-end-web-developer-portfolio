<h1>Front End Web Developer Portfolio: How To Impress</h1>
<h2>Are you a front end developer looking for a better opportunity? Make sure to impress with your front end web developer portfolio. Read on to find out how</h2>  

<p>The front end web developer is one of the most in-demand jobs in the world. If you are one, you should know your worth. There are many business-related opportunities waiting for you, so you should be able to find a job with a company that is willing to pay more for your services. But then you have to hone a particular skill set related to the industry you’re in. Without well-molded skills, it can be very tough for you to become more technically competitive than others.</p>
<p>This is why you need to impress. One way to do that is through the <a href="https://www.ramotion.com/agency/web-design/">front end web developer portfolio</a>. But what makes a great portfolio? There are things you have to know to determine if the portfolio is great or not. Of course, you have to use this aspect as a criterion when choosing a web design and development firm. A portfolio is basically the source of credentials and reference of trustworthiness. The front-end web development company businesses need to hire must have an awesome portfolio. If you want to join the force of web developers in the world today, this must be your priority above all things.</p>
<h3>Impress with your front end web developer portfolio</h3>
<p>A positive impression can give you the success level that you’re really dreaming of. So, the most basic content of your portfolio is the collection of your <a href="https://medium.com/theymakedesign/front-end-development-companies-984ed848c39b">front end developer projects</a>. It is a given, of course, that you have to show off your previous projects. But you also need to be circumspect about what to show.</p>
<p>Versatility is important. If you are applying to be a front end developer, it is necessary that you showcase the different facets of your capabilities. You want the company you are applying for to know that you can do anything. </p>
<p>Showing your various projects is also a good way to catch the attention of a company. A company may be looking for a specific kind of output. If you have a versatile list of projects, then there is a distinct possibility that you are exactly what the company is looking for. </p>
<p>However, if you hear that there is a specific output that the company is looking for, then it would also be advantageous if you show off that expertise. You might include a few samples of that particular output in your front end web developer portfolio. But that doesn’t mean you shouldn’t include other kinds of outputs. You can show your versatility and expertise at the same time.</p>
<h3>UI / UX Design</h3>
<p>Actually, in most cases, the portfolio is straightforward because you don’t want to make the company do much while perusing through your resume. </p>
<p>First of all, your portfolio should be digital. That was a given, right? You can’t showcase how good you are in print. In a digital portfolio, though, you can showcase your creativity. The portfolio should be pleasing to the eyes and it should be easy for the company to navigate. </p>
<p>The user interface and user experience are the best way to really explain what front end web development is about. The front end is what users see, and what they should be enjoying. This means that it should be pleasing to the eyes and navigating it should be a pleasing experience. </p>
<p>How do you showcase both designs in your portfolio? This is a good question which you have to deeply understand. The answer to this question should enlighten your mind as to why you badly need to hone skills in relation to UI and UX designing.</p>
<h3>But what about newbies?</h3>
<p>Just because you’ve never had a job before, it doesn’t mean that you can’t provide a front end web developer portfolio. You may not have projects yet, but you surely have some ideas on creating websites. After all, you wouldn’t be applying for such a job if you have no interest in web development. </p>
<p>Then, check out some mockups that can help you with the presentation design so that your portfolio will look lively and interesting. </p>
<p>Now, what should be highlighted in your portfolio?</p>
<h3>Brief description</h3>
<p>You know how Facebook is a game of narratives while Twitter is a game of wits? On Facebook, you can say so much without repercussions. On Twitter, if you say so much, you will be cut off. In other words, you have to say something loud with the least amount of characters possible. </p>
<p>That’s exactly what websites are about and you could showcase how creative you are with words in your portfolio. </p>
<p>When creating websites, though, there are always content creators. The front end web developer doesn’t have to be great with words because a content creator can be hired. But this doesn’t mean that you should just take words for granted. Ask a friend to help you out with the words. It doesn’t mean that you are incompetent as a front end web developer, it only means that you know your job well. </p>
<p>Say as many things as you can with the fewest possible number of words. That means that you don’t use unnecessary words. </p>
<p>Let me take you to an example from MattFarley.ca. The cover page is simply headlined: Designer, front-end developer & mentor. The opening statement says: I design and code beautifully simple things, and I love what I do. </p>
<p>The statement says a lot. It tells us what he does for a living and also tells us that he doesn’t mind that kind of work. </p>
<p>Underneath those words are a caricature of the developer and a graphical representation of front end development. It’s simple and neat. Then of course, the succeeding pages showcase what the developer has done before. </p>
<h3>Images</h3>
<p>This is very important. You have to know what image is powerful enough to get you hired. Again, this goes back to versatility. </p>
<p>Every person has a basic tell. It’s like a watermark. A lot of people can tell that it was your work because of that tell. You have to note that tell and make sure that it doesn’t show in the images you are trying to put in your front end developer portfolio. </p>
<p>If you are applying to be a front end developer of a website development company, it basically means that you would be subjected to different kinds of projects. Each project should be customized, which is why you shouldn’t have your mark in it. It’s not like a <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jordilippemcgraw/2020/08/11/night-photography-tips/#56119ab83726" rel="nofollow">photograph</a> that you can mark. </p>
<p>So when you go through your outputs to check which ones you could include in the portfolio, make sure you showcase various types of design. The entire portfolio lineup should have different types of design. You can also play with different colors and even include black and white just to show that you have that range. </p>
<p>Speaking of range, this is very important to showcase as well. This means that you can handle whatever is thrown your way. That’s exactly what it means to work for the web development company. Since you don’t have a hand in getting clients, then you have to adapt when a client is thrown your way. </p>
<p>This is what makes a front end developer very special. It is the ability to transform what the client wants into a technical creation that users will enjoy. Plus, user enjoyment should lead to possible conversion in order to make the whole web development design successful. It’s a matter of giving clients what they need by transforming data into something the users will gobble up. </p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Being in the web design and development industry is a tough job. You need to learn a lot of interrelated things. As a web developer, it is important to know that your main job is to make the business you’re serving a highly competitive one. The competitive advantage of the business organization should be present. That is why if you want to become a full-pledged front-end web developer, you need to make sure that you understand everything about website design and its front-end aspects. At the same time, it is significant that you comprehend the idea about continuous process. There has to be continuity. In a nutshell, the functions must not end on the front-end development aspect but goes beyond that. Ranking the business website is the most challenging task after all. It is through this where your potential business client will be able to experience sustaining growth and success.</p>
